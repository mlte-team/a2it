## System-Level Framework Draft

**Goal**: A comprehensive (broad and shallow) guide to building an intelligent system. Currently, we decompose this goal into four distinct sub-sections:
- Modeling
- Architecture
- User Experience
- Deployment and Maintenance

Make the interface between the _model team_ and the _system team_ explicit.
